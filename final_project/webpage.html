<h3><p>About Me</p></h3>
 Hi, My name is Eliana Solano Cumbicos. I am currently going to start 10th grade and go to Common Ground High School. I am 14 years old and
have 2 siblings. I am trying out new things (such as coding) to figure out what I want to do as a career. I enjoy listening to music, drawing,
and writing.

<h3><p>Common Ground High School</p></h3>
Common Ground High School is an agriculure school that's goal is to connect students to the enviornment. The school is located near a forest
allowing students hike, learn more about the outdoors, and get a hands on learning experience. Common Ground is rich in diversity so that many
different perspectives and ideas are contributed to group disscusions. Social justice and enviormental justice are also key values
to Commom Ground. Common Ground doors are open to all ages not just high school students. (click on the logo to access the Common Ground website)

<h3><p>Why make this website?</p></h3>
I am going to a coding camp at Holberton which has really helped learn more about coding. It has taught me the importance of coding because
it is in most of our everyday items (phones, tablets, computers, and more). Technology is evolving rapidly, and coding is a key element to
technology. For this reason I made this website to keep praticing coding.
